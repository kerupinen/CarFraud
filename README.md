•	Developed machine learning models, including Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks, achieving a Random Forest classification accuracy of 97%.
•	Preprocessed and cleaned datasets with 33+ features, applying transformations such as one-hot encoding and numerical encoding.
•	Addressed class imbalance with up-sampling and down-sampling techniques, improving recall and F1 scores for fraudulent claim detection.
•	Conducted chi-squared statistical analysis to identify significant features and removed biased variables like age and gender to enhance fairness.
•	Validated model performance using k-fold cross-validation, sensitivity testing with unseen data, and real-world simulations.
